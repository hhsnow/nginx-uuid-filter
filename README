Nginx Canonical UUID filter 
--

Description:
--

Issues identifying cookies. Based on ngx_http_userid_filter_module except that uses libuuid
to generate random uuids AND encodes the ids in the canonical hex format (8-4-4-4-12) as
opposed to base64 encoded.

Build Requirements:
--

libuuid-devel

Installation:
--

You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
(modified to suit your path of course):

./configure --add-module=/absolute/path/to/nginx-uuid-filter
make
make install


Usage:
--

Add to your Nginx config file's http block the following directives:

    # Use UUID Module for cookie generation and tracking
    uuid            on;
    uuid_name       cookie_name;
    uuid_domain     .example.com;
    uuid_path       /;
    uuid_expires    2y;
    uuid_p3p        'CP="NOI CUR ADM OUR NOR STA NID"';

Example Result Header:
Set-Cookie: cookie_name=4b38f964-8916-4061-a8ec-bfdb8cd88e94; expires=Fri, 25-Aug-17 18:09:14 GMT; domain=.example.com; path=/
